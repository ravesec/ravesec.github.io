# What is Grafana?

Grafana is a data visualization and analytics platform that allows you to query, visualize, and alert on data with the use of customizable dashboards.

Grafana can be used to visualize any kind of data no matter where it is stored. Below are some examples of different dashboards / data visualizations that are possible with Grafana that can be found on the [official website](https://grafana.com/grafana/).

## Dashboard Examples

## Network Visualization

For this project, I will be using Grafana to visualize information from devices and servers in my homelab, including a Palo Alto firewall, a Cisco Switch, and OpenWRT access point, and two Proxmox servers. I will be using [community made dashboards](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) to achieve this.

# Getting Started
## Relevant Links

<https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/debian/>

Grafana offers a forever free plan that lets you host Grafana in the cloud, however I will be self-hosting my instance. Grafana supports Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL/Fedora, SUSE/openSUSE, macOS, and Windows. For my installation I will be using Debian.

## Creating the Virtual Machine

I will be using Proxmox to host Grafana. 

### General

![Desktop View](/assets/img/creating-grafana-vm-general.png)

I am creating my VM on my second proxmox server since it already has the Debian 12 install CD downloaded and ready to use. I named the VM Grafana, assigned it a VM ID of 200, and made it start on boot.

### OS

![Desktop View](/assets/img/creating-grafana-vm-os.png)

For the OS settings, I am using a Debian 12.9 install CD with Linux 6.x-2.6 kernel for the guest OS.

### System

![Dektop View](/assets/img/creating-grafana-vm-system.png)

For the system settings, I enabled the QEMU agent and left all other options default.

### Disks

![Desktop View](/assets/img/creating-grafana-vm-disks.png)

For the disk settings, I gave the VM 32GB of storage to start with, as it can be increased later if needed. Additionally I enabled discard and write-back cache mode for increased VM performance.

### CPU

![Desktop View](/assets/img/creating-grafana-vm-cpu-1.png)
_Allocation Section_

![Desktop View](/assets/img/creating-grafana-vm-cpu-2.png)
_Extra CPU Flags Section_

#### Allocation
Grafana requires a minimum of 1 CPU core. For my install I will give it 4 cores spanning two sockets to match the physical configuration of the host. I also enabled NUMA, and changed the CPU type to "Host".

#### CPU Flags
Due to the old hardware that my Proxmox server is running on, it is necessary for me to disable the AES instruction set to get VMs to work. I also disable 1GB size pages (pdpe1gb) for increased performance. Everything else can remain default.

### Memory

![Desktop View](/assets/img/creating-grafana-vm-memory.png)

Grafana requires a minimum of 512MB memory. I will enable balooning to save resources, then set the minimum memory to 512MiB and the max memory to 6144MiB.

### Network

![Desktop View](/assets/img/creating-grafana-vm-network.png)

For the network settings, I will attach this VM to my Trusted Servers network (VLAN 40) and disable the firewall. All other settings remain default.

## Installing Debian

Debian was installed headless and with the following settings:
```text
IP Address: 192.168.103.200
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.103.254
Nameserver: 192.168.103.5
Hostname: grafana
Domain: dean.lan
```
## Installing Grafana

![Desktop View](/assets/img/grafana-vm-shell.png)
_A shell on the new Grafana VM._

Now that we have access to a shell, we can start the installation process by following the offical [installation instructions](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/debian/) for Debian.

### Step 1: Installing packages

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https software-properties-common wget
```

### Step 2: Import the GPG key

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings/
wget -q -O - https://apt.grafana.com/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg > /dev/null
```

### Step 3: Add the repository, Update the list of available Packages and Install the latest OSS release of Grafana

The installation guide gives instructions for adding the stable and the beta repository for Grafana as well as installing the enterprise version of Grafana. For this install I will choose the stable OSS release.

```bash
# Add the repository for stable releases
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/grafana.gpg] https://apt.grafana.com stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list

# Update the list of available packages
sudo apt-get update

# Install the latest OSS release of Grafana
sudo apt-get install grafana
```

## Setting up the Grafana Server
### Relevant Links
<https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/start-restart-grafana/>
<https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-grafana/>


Next we will start the server and configure it to start at boot with systemd.

### Step 1: Start the server and confirm that it is running

```bash
# Start the service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start grafana-server

# Verify that the service is running
sudo systemctl status grafana-server
```

![Desktop View](/assets/img/grafana-service-is-running.png)
_Output showing the status of grafana-server._

### Step 2: Serve Grafana on a port less than 1024 (Optional)

By default, the Grafana server listens on port 3000. Later I will configure the server to listen on port 443, so I will need to add a systemd unit override to grant the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability.

```bash
# Edit the service
sudo systemctl edit grafana-server.service
```

```ini
[Service]
# Give the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE capability
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

# A private user cannot have process capabilities on the host's user
# namespace and thus CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE has no effect.
PrivateUsers=false
```

```bash
# Restart the Grafana server
sudo systemctl restart grafana-server
```

### Step 3: Configure Grafana

Next, I will configure some settings for the Grafana instance. My Grafana configuration file is located at `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`. All values in this file have default values, so I only need to uncomment things I want to change.

The changes I made to the server are below:

```ini
# /etc/grafana/grafana.ini

[server]
# Protocol changed to https from http
protocol = https

# Minimum TLS value is set to TLS1.2
min_tls_version = "TLS1.2"

# The port is changed to 443 from 3000
http_port = 443

# The FQDN is set
domain = grafana.dean.lan
```

Make sure to restart the server to apply the settings and verify that the server is running.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart grafana-server.service
sudo systemctl status grafana-server.service

# Ensure Grafana is listening on the correct port
sudo ss -luntp
```

We should now be able to access the server over https after accepting the security warning:

![Desktop View](/assets/img/grafana-login-page.png)
_The Grafana login page._

After logging in with the default credentials `admin:admin`, you will be warned about using default credentials and asked to change them.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/grafana-default-credential-warning.png)
_Warning about using default credentials._

After changing the credentials (or skipping), you are redirected to the welcome page.

# Setting up Data Sources

Next, we will configure data sources so use for the future dashboards. The two data sources I will need are Prometheus and Telegraf / InfluxDB.

## Prometheus

### What is Prometheus?

From the [official documentation](<https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/>):
Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. 

Prometheus collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e. metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.

Prometheus collects metrics from targets by scraping metrics HTTP endpoints.

I will create a VM for the Prometheus instance.

### Creating the Virtual Machine

The VM is the same as the Grafana VM I created above, so I will skip that.

### Installing Debian

Debian was installed headless and with the following settings:
```
IP Address: 192.168.103.201
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.103.254
Nameserver: 192.168.103.5
Hostname: prometheus
Domain: dean.lan
```

### Installing Prometheus

To install Prometheus, I will follow the official [getting started](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/) guide.

#### Downloading and Running Prometheus

```bash
# Download the latest release of Prometheus from https://prometheus.io/download/
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v3.4.0-rc.0/prometheus-3.4.0-rc.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Extract the archive and cd into the new folder
tar xvzf prometheus-*.tar.gz
cd prometheus-*
```

Before Prometheus is started it needs to be configured. According to the guide, we can configure Prometheus to monitor itself as a first step.

##### Configuring Self-Monitoring

Create the following configuration in a file called `prometheus.yml`

```yml
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'codelab-monitor'

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
```

Now we can start Prometheus. After it starts, we can navigate to http://192.168.103.201:9090/targets to see a status page.

```bash
# Start Prometheus.
./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
```

![Desktop View](/assets/img/prometheus-status-page.png)
_The Prometheus status page showing itself as a target._

#### Add the Prometheus Data Source into Grafana

In order to use the new data source, it must be added to Grafana. I've included the steps below.

1. Inside the Grafana web UI, navigate to `Home > Connections > Data Sources`.
2. Click the "+ Add new data source" button.
3. Select Prometheus from the list of supported data sources
4. Choose an appropriate name for the data source, and supply the connection information. For this data source there is no authentication and TLS certificate validation is skipped.
5. Scroll to the bottom and click "Save & test". You will see a message saying that the data source has been successfully added.

# Setting up Dashboards
## Relevant Links
<https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/getting-started/build-first-dashboard/>
<https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/>

## Proxmox Dashboard

For the Proxmox dashboard, I chose this community made dashboard, [Proxmox via Prometheus](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10347-proxmox-via-prometheus/)

The dashboard is fed by a Prometheus data source that is populated by a [prometheus-pve-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-pve/prometheus-pve-exporter) data source.

### Installing the PVE Exporter

Since I have two Promxox servers, I will install the exporter on both instances of Proxmox using this [guide](https://github.com/prometheus-pve/prometheus-pve-exporter/wiki/PVE-Exporter-on-Proxmox-VE-Node-in-a-venv).

First, we need to install the exporter in a venv and verify that it is executable.

```bash
# Make sure venv is installed
apt update && apt install python3-venv

# Prepare a new env for the PVE exporter
python3 -m venv /opt/prometheus-pve-exporter

# Install PVE Exporter into the new env
/opt/prometheus-pve-exporter/bin/pip install prometheus-pve-exporter

# Check whether pve_exporter is executable
/opt/prometheus-pve-exporter/bin/pve_exporter --help
```

![Desktop View](/assets/img/verify-pve-exporter-is-executable.png)
_Verified that the pve exporter is executable_

Next, we generate the config file. Note that I have already created a user on my proxmox instance with the appropriate permissions (PVEAuditor) and different credentials.

```bash
mkdir -p /etc/prometheus
cat <<EOF > /etc/prometheus/pve.yml
default:
    user: prometheus@pve
    password: sEcr3T!
    verify_ssl: false
EOF
```

Now we can configure the exporter to start on boot using systemd.

```bash
# Create the unit file
cat <<EOF> /etc/systemd/system/prometheus-pve-exporter.service
[Unit]
Description=Prometheus exporter for Proxmox VE
Documentation=https://github.com/znerol/prometheus-pve-exporter

[Service]
Restart=always
User=root
ExecStart=/opt/prometheus-pve-exporter/bin/pve_exporter --config.file /etc/prometheus/pve.yml

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

# Reload systemd and start and enable the unit
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start prometheus-pve-exporter
```

Now we can see that the service is running and producing output:
![Desktop View](/assets/img/pve-exporter-service-is-running.png)
_The exporter service is running successfully_

![Desktop View](/assets/img/pve-exporter-service-output.png)
_Output produced by the service_

### Configuring Prometheus to Scrape the new Endpoints

On the main Prometheus server, we can edit the `promethus.yml` file and add the new endpoints that were just created. The new file looks like this:

```yml
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'codelab-monitor'

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']
  - job_name: 'pve'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - 10.10.11.26:9221  # Proxmox VE node with PVE exporter.
        - 10.10.11.27:9221  # Proxmox VE node with PVE exporter.
    metrics_path: /pve
    params:
      module: [default]
      cluster: ['1']
      node: ['1']
```

Restarting the server, we can check the Promethus status page again. The status page now shows the new endpoints.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/updated-prometheus-status-page.png)
_Promethus status page showing the new Proxmox endpoints_

### Adding the Dashboard to Grafana

Now that we have everything we need, we can add the [Proxmox via Prometheus](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10347-proxmox-via-prometheus/) dashboard to Grafana.

To add the dashboard, you can either upload a dashboard JSON file, copy and paste a link to the dashboard into Grafana, or directly copy and paste the JSON into Grafana. The steps I took to add the dashboard are below:

1. Inside the Grafana web UI, navigate to `Home > Dashboards`.
2. Select the "New" dropdown box, and select "Import"
3. Paste the link to the dashboard and click "Load".
4. Grafana will load the dashboard and generate a UID for it.
5. Select the Prometheus data source we just configured.
6. Click the "Import" button. Grafana will import the dashboard and take you to it. [Snapshot of the dashboard](https://snapshots.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/Tpow0LP1XqnHjP5thzoQuqj7W9TeJjHl)

## OpenWRT Dashboard

For the OpenWRT dashboard, I chose the community made dashboard [OpenWRT](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18153-asus-openwrt-router/)

The dashboard is fed by a Prometheus instance that is populated by Prometheus node Lua scripts that are installed on the OpenWRt device.

### Installing the Node Exporter Scripts

First we ssh into the OpenWRT device.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/openwrt-shell.png)
_A root terminal on the OpenWRT device._

Next, we update opkg and install the exporter scripts.

```bash
# Update the package repository
opkg update

# Install the exporter scripts
opkg install prometheus-node-exporter-lua prometheus-node-exporter-lua-nat_traffic prometheus-node-exporter-lua-netstat prometheus-node-exporter-lua-openwrt prometheus-node-exporter-lua-wifi prometheus-node-exporter-lua-wifi_stations
```

Once the scripts are installed, we need to expose the `x.x.x.x:9100/metrics` endpoint so that the Prometheus server can reach it and fetch the data. The configuration file is located here: `/etc/config/prometheus-node-exporter-lua`

On my device, the interface I will need to listen on is 'MGT'. My final configuration file looks like this:

```
config prometheus-node-exporter-lua 'main'
	option listen_port '9100'
	option listen_interface 'MGT'
```

Now we restart the exporter and verify that it is working correctly:

```bash
# restart the service
/etc/init.d/prometheus-node-exporter-lua restart

# check the status. If successful, returns "running"
/etc/init.d/prometheus-node-exporter-lua status

# Ensure that the endpoint is exposed
netstat -luntp | grep "9100"
```

_Verifying that the exporter scripts are producing output_

### Configuring Prometheus to Scrape the new Endpoint

On the main Prometheus server, we need to edit the `prometheus.yml` file and add the newly exposed endpoint. The updated configuration file looks like this:

```yml
global:
  scrape_interval:     15s # By default, scrape targets every 15 seconds.

  # Attach these labels to any time series or alerts when communicating with
  # external systems (federation, remote storage, Alertmanager).
  external_labels:
    monitor: 'codelab-monitor'

# A scrape configuration containing exactly one endpoint to scrape:
# Here it's Prometheus itself.
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'prometheus'

    # Override the global default and scrape targets from this job every 5 seconds.
    scrape_interval: 5s

    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']

  - job_name: 'pve1'
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - 10.10.11.26:9221  # Proxmox VE node with PVE exporter.
        - 10.10.11.27:9221
    metrics_path: /pve
    params:
      module: [default]
      cluster: ['1']
      node: ['1']

  - job_name: "OpenWRT"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["10.10.11.29:9100"]
```

After editing the config file and restarting the server, we can verify that the endpoint is shown on the status page.

![Desktop View](/assets/img/prometheus-openwrt-endpoint-status.png)

### Adding the Dashboard to Grafana

Next, we will add the [OpenWRT Dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18153-asus-openwrt-router/) to Grafana. The steps are the same as adding the Proxmox dashboard, so I will skip it. Once the dashboard is imported, we can view the data. You can [view a snapshot of the dashboard here](https://snapshots.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/hMbKDilSkwiGalGeq0uLJT0N3ZXYg93r).
